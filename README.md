# How to Use a PHP file

The project runs o PHP so first of all you have to download Apache (using either wamp or xamp server), 
then you have to open the datbase using phpmyadmin(which comes along with the server),
then you need to create the database with same name as of database stored in the repository,
then go to export and export the database to access its content.

# Info

The Project is solves the purpose of showing DSC-BVP blog and newsletter along with it also provides the way to login for each core memeber of the society later it can be upgraded to create the dashboard for each member where they can keep record of each memeber of their team.Although the dashboard is not ready and I am still working on forget password code and still facing some issues in it.
